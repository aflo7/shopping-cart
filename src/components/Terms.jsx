                    ** Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR
                    payment option that is only available if you select it at
                    checkout in the U.S. for eligible Apple products purchased
                    at Apple Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or
                    by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval
                    and credit limit. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for more
                    information about eligible products. Variable APRs for Apple
                    Card other than ACMI range from 15.99% to 26.99% based on
                    creditworthiness. Rates as of June 1, 2023. If you buy an
                    ACMI eligible product by choosing to pay in full with Apple
                    Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to
                    the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping
                    on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0%
                    APR. Currently, carrier connection with AT&T, T-Mobile, or
                    Verizon is required for all iPhone purchases made with ACMI
                    from Apple Store locations only. Starting August 15, 2023,
                    carrier connection with AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon is
                    required for all iPhone purchases made with ACMI. Starting
                    August 15, 2023, the ACMI installment term for new Apple
